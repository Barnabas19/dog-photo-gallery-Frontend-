                    Dogs, often hailed as humans’ best friends, have 
                    been the topic of many scientific studies looking 
                    into how they might boost 
                    our well-being. In this Spotlight, we’ll explain 
                    how your friendly pup can benefit your health 
                    across the board.

                    According to the American Society for the 
                    Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), an 
                    estimated 78 million dogs are owned as pets in 
                    the United States. It is unclear when dogs were 
                    first domesticated, but a study published last 
                    year claims that, at least in Europe, dogs were 
                    tamed 20,000–40,000 years ago. It is likely that 
                    humans and dogs have shared a special bond of 
                    friendship and mutual support ever since at least 
                    the Neolithic period — but why has this bond been 
                    so long-lasting?

                    Of course, these cousins of the wolves have 
                    historically been great at keeping us and our 
                    dwellings safe, guarding our houses, our cattle, 
                    and our various material goods. Throughout history, 
                    humans have also trained dogs to assist them with 
                    hunting, or they have bred numerous quirky-looking 
                    species for their cuteness or elegance. However, 
                    dogs are also — and might have always been — truly 
                    valued companions, famed for their loyalty and 
                    seemingly constant willingness to put a smile on 
                    their owners’ faces.

                    In this Spotlight, we outline the research that 
                    shows how our dogs make us happier, more resilient 
                    when facing stress, and physically healthier, to

                <h2 class="watermark-heading">How Dogs Keep You In Good Health</h2>
                <p class="watermark-paragraph">
                    Many studies have suggested that having dogs as 
                    pets is associated with better physical health, 
                    as reviews of the existing literature show. These 
                    findings persist.
                </p>
                <p class="watermark-paragraph">
                    Just last year, Medical News Today reported on 
                    a study that showed that owning a dog reduces a 
                    person’s risk of premature death by up to a third. 
                    Also, researchers at the University of Harvard in 
                    Cambridge, MA, suggest that dog owners have a lower 
                    risk of heart disease. Why is that? It is difficult 
                    to establish a causal relationship between owning a 
                    dog and enjoying better health. However, the 
                    benefits may appear thanks to a series of factors 
                    related to lifestyle adjustments that people tend 
                    to make after they decide to adopt a canine friend.
